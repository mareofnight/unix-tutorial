          <p>Commands in Unix use the following format:</p>

          <div class="code">
              <kbd>[utility] [options] [path1] [path2]</kbd>
          </div>

          <p>A Unix <strong>utility</strong> is a program included in the Unix OS.
          Each command entered into the Unix terminal starts with the name of the
          utility being used. In some cases, such as when starting a program
          without opening a particular file, this is the only necessary part of
          the command.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Options</strong> are added next. They are used to alter the
          way a utility runs. There are two different formats for options: a
          double dash followed by several characters, or a single dash followed by a
          single character. Some options can be written both ways. For example, in the
          <kbd>ls</kbd> utility (used to list the contents of a directory), the
          options <kbd>--all</kbd> and <kbd>-a</kbd> both show hidden as well as
          non-hidden files.
          </p>

          <p>If the command will be interacting with files or directories, their
          <strong>paths</strong> come next. Usually, the path(s) will be relative
          to the working directory, the first path will be the input, and the
          second will be the output. If no paths are specified, defaults will be
          used instead. The default output is the terminal window, and the default
          input is the keyboard.
          </p>

          <p>Spaces are used to separate each part of a command. Because spaces
          are used as delimiters, they should not be used in names of files.
          (Underscores and camel casing can be used instead.) After typing a
          command, press enter to finish and run it.
          </p>

          <p>Some features of unix, such as <a href="../redirection">redirection</a>, require
          additional information in the command. Formatting for use with these
          features is covered in the relevant sections of the tutorial.</p>
