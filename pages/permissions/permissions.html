      <p>Permissions in Unix determine who can do what to a given file or
      directory. On a personal computer, they can be used to mark files as
      read-only. On a computer with many users, setting file permissions correctly
      is important for enabling sharing or collaboration while keeping files safe
      from accidental changes and vandalism.

          <h3>User Types</h3>
          <p><strong>User</strong> (<span class="code">u</span>) is the owner of
          the file or directory. When workign with your own files, this is you.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Group</strong> (<span class="code">g</span>) refers to other
          users that are in the same user grop as the owner of the file.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Other</strong> (<span class="code">o</span>) referes to any
          users that are not the owner or members of the same group as the owner.
          </p>
          <p><strong>All</strong> (<span class="code">a</span>) referes to all
          three user types. Setting the permissions for all will affect all user
          types.

          <h3>Permission Types</h3>
          <p><strong>Read</strong> (<span class="code">r</span>) is permission to
          view a file or the contents of a directory.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Write</strong> (<span class="code">w</span>) is permission to
          save changes to or save over a file, add files to a directory, or delete
          a file or directory.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Execute</strong> (<span class="code">x</span>) is permission
          to run a file that is an executable program or open files inside a
          directory (provided the user also has read permission for those files).

          <h3>Formats</h3>
          <p>Permissions can be written as a three digit number or a string of
          nine characters. Unix's list utility displays permissions in the nine
          character format. Web-related applications often use the numeric format.
          </p>
          <h4>Nine Character Format</h4>
          <p>In the nine character format, the first three characters represent
          the owner of the file, the second set of three represents that user's
          group, and the last three represent all other users. Within each set of
          three, the first represents permission to read, the second write, and
          the third execute. Permissions are represented by their letters
          (r, w, x), and lack of permission is represented by a dash (-).
          </p>
          <h5>Example: all users have all permissions</h5>
          <div class="code">
              rwxrwxrwx
          </div>
          <h5>Example: all users have permission to read only</h5>
          <div class="code">
              r--r--r--
          </div>
          <h5>Example: no one has permission to use the file</h5>
          <div class="code">
              ---------
          </div>
          <h5>Example: the owner may read and write the file, and no one else may use it</h5>
          <div class="code">
              rw-------
          </div>
          <h4>Three Digit Format</h4>
          <p>In the three digit format, the first digit represents the user who
          owns the file, the second represents other users in the same group, and
          the third represents everyone else. The following method can be used to
          determine the value of each digit:
          </p>
          <ol>
              <li>Start with 0.</li>
              <li>If this type of user can read, add 4.</li>
              <li>If this type of user can write, add 2.</li>
              <li>If this type of user can execute, add 1.</li>
              <li>Repeat for the other two types of users to determine the other
              two digits.</li>
          </ol>
          <h5>Example: all users have all permissions</h5>
          <div class="code">
              777
          </div>
          <h5>Example: all users have permission to read only</h5>
          <div class="code">
              444
          </div>
          <h5>Example: no one has permission to use the file</h5>
          <div class="code">
              000
          </div>
          <h5>Example: the owner may read and write the file, and no one else may use it</h5>
          <div class="code">
              600
          </div>

          <h3>Examples</h3>
          <p>644 or rw-r--r-- permissions are commonly used for non-executable files on the web,
          such as HTML documents and web pages. This allows the owner of the file to read
          and write to it, and others to read it. Permission to execute is usually not
          given if the file is not executable.</p>
          <p>755 or rwxr-xr-x permissions are used for publically shared directories, including
          those in public websites. This permission setting allows the owner of a file or
          directory to read, write or execute it, and allows others to do anything except
          write.
