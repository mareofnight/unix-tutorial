        <h3>Absolute Paths</h3>
        <p><strong>Absolute paths</strong> describe where a file is relative to
        the root directory or your home directory.
        </p>
        <p>The <strong>root directory</strong> is the directory that contains
        all other files and directories. It is represented by a slash
        (<span class="code">/</span>) at the beginning of a path (as opposed to the slashes
        between parts of a path).
        </p>
        <p>A <strong>home directory</strong> is the main directory of a specific
        user. It is located at <span class="code">/home/[your username]</span>. A tilde
        (<span class="code">&#126;</span>) can be used to represent your home directory.
        </p>
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <div class="code">
            /
        </div>
        <div class="code">
            /home/tim/courses/409
        </div>
        <div class="code">
            ~
        </div>
        <div class="code">
            ~/courses/409
        </div>

        <h3>Relative Paths</h3>
        <p>Relative paths describe where a file is relative to your working
        directory. A period (<span class="code">.</span>) can be used to represent
        your working directory, but paths that do not start with a tilde or
        slash to indicate they are absolute
        are treated as relative to the working directory by default,
        so this is optional. A pair of periods (<span class="code">..</span>)
        represent the <strong>parent</strong> of a directory; that is, the
        directory that immediately contains it. Pairs of periods can be strung
        together separated by slashes as though they are file names in order
        to refer to something more than one directory higher than the working
        directory.
        </p>

        <h5>Moving to a deeper directory</h5>
        <div class="code">
            <kbd>level4/level5</kbd>
        </div>
        <h5>Moving up a level</h5>
        <div class="code">
            <kbd>..</kbd>
        </div>
        <h5>Moving up two levels</h5>
        <div class="code">
            <kbd>../..</kbd>
        </div>
        <h5>Moving up two levels and then down one</h5>
        <div class="code">
            <kbd>../../level2</kbd>
