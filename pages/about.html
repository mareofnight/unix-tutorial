    <h2>Version 3 Updates</h2>

    <section>
      <p>
        Version 3 of this website was created for a different class than versions
        1 and 2. The code changes made for version 3 can be viewed on
        <a href="https://github.com/mareofnight/unix-tutorial">GitHub</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This version is better optimized to work on a wide variety of devices
        (cell phones, tablets, large and small desktop screens). The back end
        uses PHP to stitch the pages together, instead of server side includes.
        The bulk of the JavaScript - nav.js - is tidier, and conforms to best
        practices.

    <h2>Version 2 Updates</h2>

    <section>
        <h3>Backwards Compatibility</h3>
        <p>
            Users reported that the first version of the tutorial was not viewable on
            browsers that did not recognize HTML5 tags. This was because the pale
            green background necessary to view the main text was assigned to the article
            tag, causing the text to display as black on black when the article tag
            was not recognized. In this version, HTML5 elements that have background
            colors are referenced by their ID. In addition, the body text is styled as
            white on black, and the text is changed to black with the same selector that
            sets its background color. This way, if the user's browser does not recognize
            that selector, the text will still be readable.
        </p>

        <h3>Global Navigation</h3>
        <p>
            The sidebar dropdowns are now handled by JavaScript rather than CSS alone.
            They are opened by clicking instead of hovering, which makes them easier to
            use and elminates the uncertainty of how mobile browsers will handle hovering.
            The section names' underlined text and pointer-style cursor indicate that
            they are clickable. A plus or minus symbol next to each section's name indicates
            whether it is expanded or collapsed. In order to minimize visual clutter, only
            one dropdown can be expanded at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The color scheme of the dropdowns has been changed to better match the color
            scheme of the rest of the website. The original version's dropdowns were
            extremely bright in comparison to other elements, which was visually jarring
            and drew unnecessary attention. When the user opens a navigation dropdown, its
            sudden appearance draws enough attention without the aid of bright colors.
        </p>
        <h4>Small Window Useability</h4>
        <p>
            Media queries have been added to the website's CSS to alter how it displays in
            narrow windows. This will benefit both desktop users who open tutorials in a
            small window next to their UNIX console to view both at one, and mobile device
            users. In order to preserve horizontal space, the global navigation bar becomes
            a horizontal one at the top of the screen. Global navigation links become larger
            to make them easier for mobile device users to click on. This alternate navigation
            display for small windows makes the website basically functional at viewport widths
            as narrow as 325 pixels.
        </p>

        <h3>Hidden Solutions</h3>
        <p>
            Like in the first version of the tutorial, solutions to exercises are hidden
            by default. However, in this version, shownig the solutions is handled
            by a JavaScript onclick event instead of a CSS hover. This way, the solution
            will remain visible when the user switches to another window - for example,
            their UNIX console. This also ensures that solutions will be visible on
            mobile browsers that do not account for hovering. Solutions are not collapsible
            because there is no need to hide them after having seen them. This is indicated
            by the disappearance of their plus sign.
        </p>

        <h3>Ease of Maintinance</h3>
        <p>
            The global navigation, footer and the linked files in the document head
            have been placed in external files and included via server side includes.
            This will simplify site maintinance by minimizing the number of locations
            in which changes must be made.
        </p>

    <h2>Version 1 Documentation</h2>

    <section>
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>The color scheme of this website is based on the bright text and dark
        backgrounds that terminal interefaces often use. This was done to
        associate the visual theme of the website with its content. It also
        makes the monospaced, dark-on-light sections of text, which represent
        terminal input and output, look as though they match the rest of the
        design. The majority of the text is in a dark, sans-serif on a light
        background for ease
        of reading and contrast with the terminal-style text.
        </p>
        <p>Care was taken to ensure that the website could be used easily
        with almost any size of screen. Most users of Unix tutorials would
        access them from the same device they are accessing the terminal from,
        and this would usually not be a mobile device, but graceful degredation
        to a small window size is still an important usability consideration
        because it allows the user to view the tutorial and the terminal window
        side by side. This feature also makes it accessable for mobile device
        users.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h3>Organization</h3>
        <p>The lessons in this tutorial are split up into categories. This
        improves the website's usability; there are five categories, and the
        largest category has five lessons, so the user never has to choose
        between more than five options at once. The categorization of lessons
        is based on which Unix features they have to do with, and they are
        descriptively named. This allows a user who wants to find information on
        one aspect of Unix but not an entire tutorial to find what they are
        looking for quickly.
        </p>
        <p>Within each lesson, there are topical sub-sections and sections for
        syntax, examples and exercisese within those. Users are accustomed to
        heirarchial structures and can learn to understand them quickly, so a
        heirarchy such as this is sutible for a small tutorial site that users
        will only use for a few hours at most.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Content</h3>
        <p>The subjects covered in this tutorial were chosen because they are
        relevant to all or most Unix users. Though many Unix distributions
        include GUIs, these GUIs do not follow any standard, so it is not possible
        to make a tutorial that applies to all or even most of them. Instead,
        this tutorial focuses on things that can be done through the terminal,
        the basic functionality of which varies very little between distributions.
        In cases where there are major differences, such as the use of nano
        insted of pico by distributions of Unix-like operating systems that the
        GNU project contributed to, this is noted in the relevant lesson.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p>Next and previous links are located at the top of all tutorial pages
        to indicate that there is an order to the lessons and facilitate easy
        browsing. On long pages, there is an additional set of links at the end
        of the page so the user can move on to the next lesson without having to
        scroll back to the top of the page. These links are intended as the user's
        main means of navigation when workign throuigh the tutorial for the first
        time.</p>
        <p>The index pages of each section include next and previous links as
        well. They are labeled "next topic" and "previous topic" instead of simply
        "next" and "previous" to indicate that they are for navigating between
        sections rather than individual lessons. The index pages themselves are
        relatively sparse. They exist because some users will expect all sidebar
        items to be links, including the headers, but they are inentionally
        sparse so that users who navigate directly to the lessons will not miss
        any information.
        </p>
        <p>The sidebar links can be used to jump between sections out of order.
        This functionality would be useful for returning users who want to look
        up something specific they remember from the tutorial. The sidebar has
        fixed positioning so that it never scrolls off the visible part of the
        page. This would be useful for users who wanted to move between lessons
        quicky to compare them.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Use of HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>HTML 5 was used for the markup because it has semantic tags that
        XHTML 1.1 lacks. These additional tags provide better machine readability
        and are easier to work with than the many classes of divs that would
        have been necessary to structure the page the same way in XHTML 1.1.
        </p>
        <p>External CSS stylesheets were used to keep style information
        completely separate from content and semantic markup. CSS was also used
        in place of images for the decorative text in the header and sidebar,
        improving accessibility and decreasing the size and number of files
        necessary to load the website. The stylesheet itself is divided into
        sections by comments for easy maintinance.
