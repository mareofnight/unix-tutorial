    <p><strong>Redirection</strong> in Unix is taking input of a utility from or
    sending output to a location other than the default. This can be used
    to save to or read from files using utilities that ordinarily do not save
    or read files, or to use the ouput of one utility as input for another.</p>

    <p>The concatonate utility will be used as an example of how redirection
    works in Unix because its simplicity makes it easy to observe. Concatonate
    allows input files to be specified as arguments, as described in the
    <a href="../file-dir/viewing.html" title="viewing files">viewing files</a>
    section of this tutorial. For the purposes of demonstrating redirection,
    this feature should not be used. When no files are specified as arguments,
    concatonate will use the keyboard as its input location and print its
    output to the terminal.

        <h3>How to Redirect Input</h3>
        <p>Redirecting input is useful for processing large files without having
        to re-type them.

        <h4>Syntax</h4>
        <div class="code">
            <kbd>[utility] [options] &lt; [input file]</kbd>
        </div>
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <div class="code">
            <kbd>sort &lt; unalphabetized_list.txt</kbd>
        </div>
        <h4>Exercise</h4>
        <p>Create a text file named <kbd>input-file.txt</kbd> with a few lines
        of text in it using one of the
        methods covered earlier in this tutorial. Use the concatonate utility to
        print this file. The output should be the same that you would see if
        specifying the input file as an argument.
