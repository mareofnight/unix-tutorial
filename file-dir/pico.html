    <p>Pico is a text editor included in most Unix distributions. Its main use
    is making very simple changes to text files; most people prefer to use vi
    or emacs for extensive editing.
    </p>
    <p>The following command will launch pico:
    </p>
    
    <div class="code">
        <kbd>pico</kbd>
    </div>
    
    <p>If you are using a Unix-like operating system derived from the GNU
    project, <kbd>pico</kbd> will launch nano instead of pico. Nano is
    extremely similar to pico, but with some additional features. It was
    developed as a replacement for pico because pico's licinse was not a free
    software licinse.

        <h3>A note on syntax</h3>
        <p>In Unix's help features and most resources on Unix, including this
        tutorial, the <kbd>&#94;</kbd> character represents holding down the
        control key while pressing the key immediately following it. Letters
        combined with <kbd>&#94;</kbd> should be typed without holding down
        shift, as though typing them in lower case, even if uppercase characters
        are used to represent them.
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h3>Cut</h3>
        <p><kbd>&#94;K</kbd> cuts (copies and deletes) the line of text the
        cursor is in.
        </p>
        <h4>Syntax</h4>
        <div class="code">
            <kbd>&#94;K</kbd>
        </div>
        <h4>Exercise</h4>
        <p>Use the touch utility to create a new file and open the file in Pico.
        Type a few lines of text. (Include carriage returns; line breaks
        enforced by the width of the terminal are not considered line breaks
        for the purposes of copying text.) Copy one of the lines.
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h3>Un-</h3>
        <p>The function of <kbd>&#94;U</kbd> depends on the last keystroke used.
        In general, it does the opposite of the previous keystroke. For example, after
        cutting text, <kbd>&#94;U</kbd> is used to paste. The current function
        of <kbd>&#94;U</kbd> will be displayed somewhere in pico's interface.
        </p>
        <h4>Syntax</h4>
        <div class="code">
            <kbd>&#94;U</kbd>
        </div>
        <h4>Exercise</h4>
        <p>"Uncopy" (that is, paste) the text that you copied in the previous
        exercise.
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h3>Turning the Pages</h3>
        <p>In some Unix distributions, the pico interface does not scroll, and
        text is instead displayed in pages. <kbd>&#94;V</kbd> and
        <kbd>&#94;Y</kbd> are used to
        navigate through long files that require multiple pages.
        </p>
        <h4>Syntax</h4>
        <h5>To go to the next page:</h5>
        <div class="code">
            <kbd>&#94;V</kbd>
        </div>
        <h5>To go to the previous page:</h5>
        <div class="code">
            <kbd>&#94;Y</kbd>
        </div>
        <h4>Exercise</h4>
        <p>Add some nonsense characters to the file, including carraige returns,
        to make the text extend past the first page. Observe how your distribution
        of Unix handles this; some have scroll bars in their text editors, and
        some do not. Use the previous and next commands to flip back and forth
        through the pages.
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h3>Save</h3>
        <p>Pico's save feature functions similarly to those of most programs.
        After typing the <kbd>&#94;O</kbd> keystroke, you will be given a prompt
        with the name the file will be saved as. By default, this is the file's
        original name, but you can also change it to save a copy.
        </p>
        <h4>Syntax</h4>
        <div class="code">
            <kbd>&#94;O</kbd>
        </div>
        <h4>Exercise</h4>
        <p>Save your file under a different name than the original.
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h3>Exit</h3>
        <p><kbd>&#94;X</kbd> is used to exit pico and return to the terminal.
        If changes to the file have not been saved,a prompt will give you a last
        chance to save before exiting.
        </p>
        <h4>Syntax</h4>
        <div class="code">
            <kbd>&#94;X</kbd>
        </div>
        <h4>Exercise</h4>
        <p>Exit pico, and then open your original file in pico. It should be
        empty again because you didn not save your changes to this file name.
        Exit pico again and then use it to open the copy you saved. This file
        should containt the text you entered.
        </p>
