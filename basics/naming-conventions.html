    <p>Unix does not have a standard naming convention. However, you may find
    it helpful to decide on and use a consistent method of naming files in
    order to help you stay organized. In addition, there are some features
    that are not allowed in Unix file and directory names, and others that are
    required in other operaing systems but not in Unix. The folling explanations
    should give you the necessary information for deciding on a good set of
    naming conventions for use with Unix.

        <h3>Extensions</h3>
        <p>Unlike other common operating systems, Unix does not use file extensions
        to determine the type of a file. Instead, it determines this from the
        file's header. Therefore, extensions (.txt, .jpeg, .doc, etc.) are
        optional in Unix. However, you may wish to use them anyway if you find
        them helpful for determining what a file contains, or if you will be
        moving the files to a non-Unix operating system at some point.

        <h3>Capitalization</h3>
        <p>Paths are case sensitive in Unix, so it is important to pay attention to
        case when naming files and directories. Your files and directories will be
        easier to work with if you choose a set of capitalization rules and stick
        to them so you won't have to wonder which letters are capitalized. For
        example, you might use lower case letters only, or capitalize the beginning
        of every word.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h3>Spacing</h3>
        <p>Spaces are used as delimiters in the Unix terminal. (A
        <strong>delimeter</strong> is a character used to separate parts of a
        string - in this case, a terminal command.) Spaces cannot be used in file
        and directory names in Unix because they would be interpreted as the end
        of the path and the start of the next part of the command. However, it is
        important to have some method of differentiating between words to make
        names easily readable. Two common methods are camel casing and underscores.
        </p>
        <h4>Camel Casing</h4>
        <p>In a camel cased naming scheme, names with multiple words are run
        together with no spacing, and the first letter of each word is capitalized.
        Sometimes the first letter of the first word is left lower case because
        there are no other words jammed against it to cause confusion.
        </p>
        <h4>Underscores</h4>
        <p>The underscore (<span class="code">_</span>) character looks like a
        space, but is not commonly used as a delimeter. This makes it useful for
        visually separating words within a name without the risk of programs
        misinterpreting them.
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h3>Punctuation and Special Characters</h3>
        <p>Punctuation marks should be avoided in file names because many have
        special uses in Unix. For example, slashes (<span class="code">/</span>)
        separate the parts of a path, asterisks (<span class="code">*</span>)
        and question marks (<span class="code">?</span>) are wild card
        characters, and tildes (<span class="code">~</span>) represent a user's
        home directory. Because of these complications, it is best to avoid
        using punctuation marks in file names altogether, with the exception of
        the periods that separate a file's name from its extension.
