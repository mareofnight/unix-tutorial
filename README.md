=============

This website started as a homework assignment for a class in web development. I liked the basic theme and wanted to use it for other static-html-only sites, but I avoided doing so because it doesn't display well on small screens. (It has some basic responsiveness, but it doesn't work properly on high pixel density screens.)

Now, I have a project for my mobile design class to make an existing website mobile friendly, so I'm going back to this project and fixing it. I may also make other improvements along the way.
