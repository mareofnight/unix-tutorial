        <h3>Logging In</h3>
        <p>When logging in to a computer using a Unix based or Unix-like
        operating system that does not have a GUI, the terminal will prompt you
        for a user name and password. (In most distributions that have GUIs,
        this will be done through the GUI before opening the terminal.) Note
        that when typing your password, your input will either show up as a
        character such as * or &#8226;, or not be displayed at all.
        </p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <div class="code">
            Username: <kbd>user01<br /></kbd>
            Password: <kbd>********<br /></kbd>
        </div>
        <h4>Exercise</h4>
        <p>If you are using a version of Unix that requires logging in through
        the terminal, log yourself in. If you are using a Unix distribution that
        has a GUI, open the terminal application now.

        <h3>Confirming Your Username</h3>
        <p>The whoami utility outputs your username. This is a method of
        checking which account you are logged in to.
        </p>
        <h4>Syntax</h4>
        <div class="code">
            <kbd>whoami [options]</kbd>
        </div>
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <div class="code">
            <kbd>whoami</kbd>
        </div>
        <h4>Exercise</h4>
        <p>Confirm your username using the whoami utility. You can do this using
        the same command as the example above.
        </p>

        <h3>Logging Out</h3>
        <p>If using Unix without a GUI, you can log out using the logout
        </p>
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <div class="code">
            <kbd>logout</kbd>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
            <kbd>exit</kbd>
        </div>
        <h4>Exercise</h4>
        <p>Log out or exit the terminal, and then log back in or re-open the
        terminal.
