        <h3>Syntax and Examples</h3>
        <p>Each section about a specific utility includes a line showing its
        syntax and several more examples of specific instances of its use.
        </p>
        <p>The syntax line often includes <span class="code">[words or phrases
        inside brackets]</span>. These are to be treated as "fill in the blanks".
        For example, <span class="code">[options]</span>
        should be replaced by the specific optiones being used with the command.
        The brackets themselves should not be included when using the utility in
        the terminal.
        </p>
        <p>Example commands are written exactly as they would be typed into the
        terminal. They do not include the information about the user and the
        computer they are using that the Unix terminal places at the beginning
        of each line automatically. Most examples are written in <kbd>this style
        of text</kbd>, which indicates that they are to be typed into the
        terminal by the user. Examples that use <span class="code">this style</span> instead
        represent either output, or parts of commands that can be either output
        or input.

        <h3>Exercises</h3>
        <p>Many sections in this tutorial also include suggested exercises.
        These are intended to demonstrate how the commands and utilities work,
        and in some cases, to contrast them with other, similar features.
        </p>
        <p>At the end of some exercises, there is a line of text that says
        "solution". If you have difficulty with the exercise or want to check
        your work, click this text to see the commands that must be entered to
        complete the exercise.
        </p>

        <div class="solution" onClick="solutionOpen(this);">
            <h5>solution</h5>
            <div class="code">
                <kbd>This area will display the commands you need.</kbd>
            </div>
