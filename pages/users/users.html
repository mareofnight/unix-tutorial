          <h3>Who else is logged in?</h3>
          <p>In addition to finding information about your own account, Unix
          includes utilities for finding out about the other users. One of these
          is the who utility, which returns a list of the other users that are
          currently logged in. By default, this list will be printed to the
          terminal.
          </p>
          <h4>Syntax</h4>
          <div class="code">
              <kbd>who [options]</kbd>
          </div>
          <h4>Examples</h4>
          <div class="code">
              <kbd>who</kbd>
          </div>
          <div class="code">
              <kbd>who -q</kbd>
          </div>
          <div class="code">
              <kbd>who --count</kbd>
          </div>
          <h4>Exercise</h4>
          <p>Try entering the two examples above into the console. Note how the
          output generated by the second two examples differes from the first.
          <kbd>-q</kbd> and <kbd>--count</kbd> are two different ways of entering
          the same option, which causes the output to include the total number of
          logged in users.
